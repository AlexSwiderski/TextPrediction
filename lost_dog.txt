Lost Dog


David left the front door open while getting the mail. His dog escaped and ran 


into the neighborhood. David searched for seven days and then went to the 


animal shelter to see  if  his dog was there. An employee reported a young 


couple had fallen in love with the dog and adopted him. Not wanting to upset 


the couple, David decided to get   a  new dog.
