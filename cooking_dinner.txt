Cooking Dinner

Gary started making a pan of lasagna. During the process, he ran out of 
 

tomato sauce but luckily found more in the pantry. Gary scraped the sauce into 


the pan using a knife and placed it   in the oven. As the lasagna cooked, Gary 
 

realized the knife tip was missing. To find it, Gary held a magnet above the 
  

finished dish. Finally locating the tip, he ate unconcerned.
