A Cat Story

Sam enjoyed spending time with Jack, his black cat. After arriving home 


from basketball practice on a beautiful summer day, Sam could not find Jack 

anywhere. He searched the neighborhood for months without success. 


When winter came, Sam's uncle surprised him and brought him a new kitten. 

Sam lovingly held his new friend. Then, he looked up and saw Jack sitting 


outside on the windowsill, eagerly looking inside.
