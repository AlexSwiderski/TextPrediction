Animal Invasion

Megan returned home following a hectic day. She laid down to nap but spotted 

something flying in the bedroom. Megan thought it was a bat but quickly 

realized it was a bird. She rushed to the kitchen and grabbed a mixing bowl 

and a   magazine. Meg positioned the bowl over the animal while using the 

magazine to trap it.  She transported the confined bird outside and released it.
